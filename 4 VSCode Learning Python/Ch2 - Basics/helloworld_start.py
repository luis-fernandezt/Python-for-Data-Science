# The code above is a simple Python script that prints "Hello World" to the console and then prompts the user for their name, printing a greeting with their name.
# The script defines a main function that contains the logic, and it checks if the script is being run directly before calling the main function.
# The script is a simple example of how to use the print and input functions in Python, as well as how to define and call a function.
